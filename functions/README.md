## Exercise 1
Write a program that calculates the perimeter and area of any triangle whose 3 sides are supplied by the user.  
The area of any triangle is calculated using the formula: `sqrt(d * (d - a) * (d - b) * (d - c))`.  
And `d` is the semi perimeter.  
Note: The sum of two sides must be larger than the third.
