## Exercise 1
Write a program that asks the user to enter a file name, which file is intended to be opened for reading. If the file exists, display the message "This file does exist." otherwise, "The file \<filename\> cannot be found." The portion of the program that handles the exception will be included in the **file_exist()** function.
